Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands into a normal Python script, then you run it with streamlit run:

```
streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]
```

As soon as you run the script as shown above, a local Streamlit server will spin up and your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser. The app is your canvas, where you'll draw charts, text, widgets, tables, and more.

What gets drawn in the app is up to you. For example `st.text` writes raw text to your app, and `st.line_chart` draws a line chart. 

Another way of running Streamlit is to run it as a Python module. This can be useful when configuring an IDE like PyCharm to work with Streamlit:

```
python -m streamlit run your_script.py
```

## Execution

```
(.venv) âžœ  crash-course-for-beginners git:(main) âœ— streamlit run hello-streamlit.py
